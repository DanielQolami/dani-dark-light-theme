# dani-dark-light-theme
A Simple JavaScript project to toggle dark/light theme using JavaScript.

code is very simple. I used some colors in the CSS root, and change them via JavaScript to dark colors.

SVGs are from [unDraw.co](https://undraw.co/illustrations) website.

see the results, here. https://danielqolami.github.io/dani-dark-light-theme/
